Resources
#########

Resources are representations of system resources, such as files, processes...
One of XAL's main purpose is to define a consistent set of resources with a
reference API.

Implementation of resources is not XAL's main scope. XAL focuses on API.
That said, as a proof of concept, XAL implements some resource providers for
use with a local session.

   The resources below are the ones currently implemented in XAL. Since XAL is
   not mature yet, many resources have not been implemented yet. Learn more
