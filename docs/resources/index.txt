Resources
*********

`xal` resources are Python representations of system resources such as files,
sh commands, processes, users... One of `xal`'s main purpose is to define a
consistent set of resources with a reference API.

There is a base class for all resources, then each resource has its own class.

Here are resources provided by `xal` itself at the moment:

* :doc:`/resources/path`
* :doc:`/resources/sh`

.. note::

   As a proof of concept, `xal` implements some resources. But is is a **work
   in progress!** Learn and contribute around features in `bugtracker`_.
